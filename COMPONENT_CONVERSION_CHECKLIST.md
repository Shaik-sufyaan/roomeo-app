## Notes:
- ✅ = Completed
- 🔄 = In Progress
- All components should follow Type C (mobile-native) conversion
- Focus on mobile UX patterns: touch gestures, native navigation, proper spacing
- Use React Native components exclusively (no HTML/CSS)
- Implement proper mobile accessibility
- **Real Data**: Mobile app now fetches actual users from Supabase instead of mock data
- Test on both iOS and Android patterns

 ultra think - Verify all the phase 3 converted files from the website component files and then mark them as complete. Make sure you converted    
  every single line and didn't miss out any functions as later on i am going to use them all. Then mark them completed in the checklist.

  Make mobile UI really good and it shouldn.t give website feel like.
